# Sebasti√°n (Sebas) Etchevest
*Tech Executive | Strategy Consultant*

Hi, I'm Sebas. For over 18 years, I've worked in the tech landscape, moving from simply building software to architecting holistic solutions. I believe technology's true purpose is to serve as a bridge between strategic business goals and tangible, human-centric outcomes. My work is about leading with practical, concrete actions and fostering a culture of shared ownership.

I partner with teams and leaders to navigate complex transformations, helping define clear objectives and find the best path forward.

### My Core Principles

*   **Strategic Architecture:** I design scalable, secure, and resilient systems that are not just technically sound but act as direct enablers of business strategy.
*   **Collaborative Leadership:** I guide teams by fostering an environment of clarity and trust. My goal is to empower people to do their best work, removing obstacles and focusing on a shared vision.
*   **Tech-Agnostic Problem-Solving:** The best tool is the one that solves the problem effectively. While I have deep expertise in various tech ecosystems, I'm driven by the solution, not a specific stack.
*   **From MVP to Global Scale:** I specialize in the full lifecycle of a digital platform, from a lean Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to robust, multi-country deployments.
